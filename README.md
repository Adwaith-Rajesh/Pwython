### Usage
You can use pwython exaclty as you would use python, just replace `python` with `python -m pwython`. For example:

This is how you would run your python code the "traditional" way

```
python main.py
```

But this is how you run it with pwython:

```
python -m pwython main.py
```

If you are on a MacOS or Linux, you can add `alias pwython="python -m pwython"` in your bashrc file and run your code directly by typing `pwython main.py` in the terminal!
