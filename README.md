### OwO what's this?
Pwython is project aiming to fill in one of the biggest problems with python, which is that it ~~is slow~~ lacks [owoified](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=OwO) text. Note that this [README](https://github.com/SystematicError/Pwython/blob/master/README_UWU.md) and [LICENSE](https://github.com/SystematicError/Pwython/blob/master/LICENSE_UWU) is available in owoified form too.
